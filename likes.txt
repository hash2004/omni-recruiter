As you may know, I take plenty of notes. And I’m always on the lookout for new tools and strategies to refine my process. Recently, I decided it was time to get my hands dirty — so, my team and I set out to build a simple note-taking aide, which transcribes and summarizes our meetings using Bedrock. Today, we’re making the proof of concept available to everyone.

Additionally, I’ve been working with Amazon Q to convert this sample app into a Rust CLI, which I plan to share in the upcoming weeks (after I have a few Rustaceans at Amazon review it for me). As someone relatively new to Rust, I have to say that Q has been a helpful collaborator, and non-judgmental teacher. If you haven’t already, I encourage you to give it a try.

It’s a reminder that it’s not always about solving the “big” problem in one swoop. Sometimes it’s about chipping away at everyday problems. Finding simple solutions that become the foundation for incremental and meaningful innovation. Now, go build!

Very excited to announce that we've taken our long-standing partnership with NVIDIA to it's next level with the integration of Nvidia's AI microservices for drug discovery and digital health on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This integration will help thousands of healthcare and life sciences companies that are using AWS to deploy generative AI more quickly, without the complexities of model development and packaging for production. 

NIM, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, enables developers to access a growing library of AI models through industry-standard application programming interfaces. The library includes foundation models for drug discovery, medical imaging and genomics, backed by enterprise-grade security and support. NIM is now available via Amazon SageMaker to deploy and manage high-performance computing clusters on AWS. The AI models can be combined across different modalities such as amino acid sequences, MRI images, and plain-text patient health records. 

Healthcare and life sciences customers are gravitating to AWS for generative AI with services like Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon Bedrock, and AWS HealthOmics, and we're very excited for Amgen, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, to be exploring our FMs for protein design with Nvidia's BioNeMo FMs and AWS HealthOmics.

I am very excited to share that today is my first Day 1 at #Amazon. I am grateful for the opportunity to lead the #AI/ML Services and Infrastructure team at AWS, joining the exceptional team that has been relentlessly inventing for customers in AI and Generative AI including the flagship AI and #generative AI services, Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, the Core Data services, and the ML infrastructure for developing deep learning frameworks and engines. AWS’s full stack approach to AI and the relentless focus on offering world class price-performance, security, and flexibility on Amazon’s purpose-built AI- and ML-focused chips (AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia),and GPUs make AWS the best place in the world to build AI applications. More than 100,000 organizations use these AI services, and the possibilities for innovations and market leading capabilities are immense. I am truly humbled by these achievements and the potential for transformation.
 
I look forward to growing this world-class #AWS team of customer obsessed innovators!

Our goal has always been to make transformative tech like GenAI accessible and easy to use for developers. Today, we’re announcing a new capability in Amazon Bedrock to do just that. https://lnkd.in/gQpefcfe

We're introducing Amazon Bedrock Studio (available in preview), a web-based experience designed to accelerate the development of GenAI applications by providing a rapid prototyping environment with Bedrock features, including Knowledge Bases, Agents, and Guardrails. With Amazon Bedrock Studio, developers can:

⚪ Easily interact with a wide range of LLMs and foundation models
⚪ Collaborate on projects with cross-functional teams
⚪ Leverage a user-friendly interface with playground mode for iterative development
⚪ Seamlessly integrate proprietary data sources, systems, and APIs
⚪ Benefit from centralized access management, policy enforcement, and responsible AI capabilities
